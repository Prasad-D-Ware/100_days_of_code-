#Fix the code below

# the double quotation was missing so it showed a Syntax error
print("Day 1 - String Manipulation")

# As we wanted the + sign inside our code we asigned all the text inside a single pair of double quotes
print("String Concatenation is done with the  +  sign.")

#unnecessary indent or space was provided in the strt of our function
print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")')

# as the function has two opening brackets it should have two in the end of the code
print(("New lines can be created with a backslash and n."))
